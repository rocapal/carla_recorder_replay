# carla_recorder_replay

This code ilustrates how to use the recorder and replay functions in CARLA (0.9.15) simulator. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adv_recorder/) for more details

# Recorder

Run **recorder.py** to record a CARLA log in the following scenario. A car drives with autopilot enabled, while a bicycle is positioned in front of it.


Keep in mind that the recorder does not save any data related with the sensors attached to the vehicles. It only stores the information required to accurately reproduce the scenario and its dynamics.

Typically the recorder is executed in **asynchronous mode**, so the client does not wait for the ticks generated by the simulator. You can enable the autopilot or drive the vehicle manually using a external controller.

As the recorder does not save any sensor data, and we want to know the car's speed while replaying the log file, we will be using a csv file. In that file, we will store two variables: current timsetamp and speed.  
Later, while doing the replay, we will join speed data with the rest of the sensor data.

# Replay

Run **replay.py** to reproduce the CARLA log previously saved with the recorder. 

Typically replay is executed in **synchronous mode** when generating synthetic datasets. This ensures that no frames or events are missed during the simulation. However, you can also replay the log in **asyncronous** mode if needed.

Dive in to the code of the **replay.py** script, and see how you can change the point of view of the actor (vehicle or bike) from which you want to analyze the simulation.

You can see below how you can run the same simulation twice from different points of view.

For the replay, as the speed csv that we created in the record was taken at **30FPS** in asynchronous mode, we need to do the replay in the same conditions so that the speed  data matches the other data (throttle, breaks, steering...). 

To make sure that frames are not missed in this **asynchronous** mode, we will be using a Queue (python queues have their own locks)

## CARLA simulator

Both examples described above require the **CARLA simulator** to be running in the following way


```bash
./CarlaUE4.sh -RenderOffScreen -carla-world-port=3010 
```

## Visualize data

There is also a script called **visualize_dataset.py**, where you can visualize all the dataset at once. Here is an example of the result:
